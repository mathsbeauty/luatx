<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The tutorials in this app are intended for beginners of LaTeX. They are written keeping in mind the difficulties of those who are used to use WYSISWYG Word processors such as Microsoft Word. Almost all tasks that one is used to do in Microsoft Word are covered. A simple principle is used: Type tutorial . . .Compile and Check the Output . . .Go through the key points . . . Get the things and you will learn LaTeX! It is a smarter way of learning LaTeX. Rather than going through manuals and references of hundreds of pages, you will learn a lot by these simple tutorials in no time.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Tutorials are crafted deliberately for novice users of LaTeX. Every tutorial is complete itself. No part is left to work out on learners side. You may go to any tutorial, type or copy it and get the output. Begining with few basic tutorials, you will learn to produce lists, tables, including figures, mathematical equations,writing books and research articles. Though it would be useful to proceed in a sequential order of tutorials, it is not needed. After reading first few sections, you may proceed to any section and skip others. A mathematics environment is discussed in detail. It is useful for learners and teachers of mathematics. If you are a student, teacher or a novice trying to learn LaTeX, look nowhere. It's a must have app for you. This app will get you through. It works offline. The detailed table of contents with simple navigation is given for easy reference.</p>
